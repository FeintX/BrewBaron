#### Gameplay

##### The Goal

The goal of Brew Baron is to earn as much profit as possible within a set number of in-game years. Each year is divided into 52 weeks with 13 week seasons. Gameplay is turn based with actions such as growing and fermenting forcing the player to advance to the next week to progress further. Some styles of beer will be more profitable during certain seasons(MÃ¤rzen/Oktoberfest beers will be more profitable during Autumn for example)

##### Modular

Gameplay in Brew Baron is done through separate modules for each step of the brewing process. The farm, malthouse, hopyard, and brewery modules can each operate completely independent of each other. This gives the player multiple options for how to start a new game. For example, the player could choose to start the game as a farmer growing and selling crops to build capital to expand into brewery, or they could choose to start with a small brewery but with the need to purchase all their supplies from the marketplace. There will be a number of preset starting options as well as the ability to customize starting conditions.

## Farm

Starting with a small farm the player can grow a variety of different grains used in the brewing process. Farm plots are laid out in a grid with each square representing one acre of land. Grains would take a few weeks to grow before they can be harvested then sold or sent to the malthouse to be malted.

* Start with 1 acre farm
* Additional plots can be purchased for xxxx dollars
* Seeds are purchased from the marketplace
    * Barley
    * Wheat
    * Oats
    * Rye
* Crops take 4 weeks from planting to be ready for harvest
* Crops need to be watered each week to ensure they don't die
    * Missed watering would reduce grain yield by 50%
* After harvesting grain can be stored, sent to the malthouse, or sold at the marketplace
    * Storage capacity can be increased for a fee
 
## Malthouse

In the malthouse the player converts raw grain from the farm or marketplace into malts used in brewing. Grains can also be smoked, roasted, toasted, and flaked to enhance certain flavors and other contributions to a beer.

* Uses grains grown on the farm or purchased from the marketplace
* Capacity can be increased for a fee
* Limited to a certain number of batches or hours completed during each weekly turn
* Equipment for roasting and flaking grains can be purchased
* Finished malts can be sent to the brewery or sold at the marketplace


## Hopyard

Functions very similar to the farm. A large variety of different hops can be grown. Hops do not need to be replanted after harvesting. However, they take longer to grow to a full size plant. The first harvest will be 10% of the final capacity. Each harvest the capacity will grow by 10% of the final capacity until that capacity is reached.
