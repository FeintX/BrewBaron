#### Gameplay

##### The Goal

The goal of Brew Baron is to earn as much profit as possible within a set number of in-game years. 

##### Modular

Gameplay in Brew Baron is done through separate modules for each step of the brewing process. The farm, malthouse, hopyard, and brewery modules can each operate completely independent of each other. This gives the player multiple options for how to start a new game. For example, the player could choose to start the game as a farmer growing and selling crops to build capital to expand into brewery, or they could choose to start with a small brewery but with the need to purchase all their supplies from the marketplace. There will be a number of preset starting options as well as the ability to customize starting conditions.
